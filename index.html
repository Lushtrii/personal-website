                <p>Hi! I'm Sean, a software developer based in Vancouver, Canada. I'm currently
                wrapping up the final year of my Computer Science degree at UBC while working on a few
                online courses, and should be available fulltime starting in January
                2025!</p>

                    <h2>Skills</h2>
                    <p>Here are the main skills I'm comfortable with. You can
                    click on each programming language to see the work I've done
                    with it. While not something I've worked with recently, I've
                    also dabbled with other languages such as SQL, TypeScript,
                    Java, and C as well.</p>
